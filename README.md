First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2017

Day Started: 1/14/18
Day Finished: 1/23/18
Number of hours worked: 12

Online resources used to develop project:
https://carlfx.wordpress.com/2012/03/29/javafx-2-gametutorial-part-1/

Files used to start project:
Breakout.java

All files within src/game_ez20 were used to test the project and errors.

All images used for the game can be found within the images folder. The level files are three text files (bricklist1, bricklist2, and bricklist3). 

There are some cheat codes that can be used during the game.
L -> grants you another life. 
1, 2, 3 -> takes you to that specific level.
Q, W -> slows down the ball/speeds up the ball.
A -> enables for vertical movement of the paddle. 
B -> makes the next ball a powerful ball (goes through any brick).
P -> freezes the ball until paddle is moved.

The extra feature I included with the game was power downs. These power downs work slightly differently than how I first 
discussed them in PLAN.txt. Instead of trying to collect the power down items, it made more sense to me to make them objects to avoid.

I enjoyed this assignment because it was a good way to just start coding. I think one thing that could be better explained 
was the guidelines for Sprint 2 of this project, as I did not realize at first that this README was required, as it was not part of the Design Checklist. It's still my fault for not looking around the website, but having a link to the software documentation rules on the same page as the Design Checklist would be helpful for people like me who were a little confused as to what was required.
